# Data structures in Python
Simple implementation of most common data structures in Python
## Currently implemented structures
### Linked List
Singly linked list with add, remove, find and print methods
### Stack
Stack implementation based on Python list, supports all typical stack operations - push, pop and peek.
### Queue
Queue supporting enqueue, dequeue, peek and clear operations.
### Max heap and min heap
Builds max or min heap from list, implemented methods: push, pop, peek.
### Binary tree
Basic binary tree implementation, with depth-first and breadth-first traversal, and flip, find and sum operations.
### Graph
Graph implementation using adjacency list, also supporting depth-first and breadth-first traversal. Other implemented operations are finding shortest path, largest component and counting connected components.
